#include <Servo.h>

// Create a Servo object named 'tap_servo'
Servo tap_servo;

// Define the pin numbers for the sensor and the tap_servo
int sensor_pin = 4;
int tap_servo_pin = 5;

// Variable to store the sensor reading
int val;

void setup() {
  // Set the sensor_pin as an input
  pinMode(sensor_pin, INPUT);

  // Attach the tap_servo to the tap_servo_pin
  tap_servo.attach(tap_servo_pin);

  // Set pin 8 as an output to control another device (e.g., LED or relay)
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Read the value from the sensor_pin and store it in 'val'
  val = digitalRead(sensor_pin);

  // If the sensor value is 0, move the tap_servo to position 0 degrees and set pin 8 to HIGH
  if (val == 0) {
    tap_servo.write(0);
    digitalWrite(8, HIGH);
  }

  // If the sensor value is 1, move the tap_servo to position 180 degrees and set pin 8 to LOW
  if (val == 1) {
    tap_servo.write(180);
    digitalWrite(8, LOW);
  }
}


In this code, in addition to controlling the servo motor based on the sensor's value, the code also uses pin 8 to control another device. When the sensor value is 0, the servo moves to position 0 degrees and the pin 8 is set to HIGH, and when the sensor value is 1, the servo moves to position 180 degrees and the pin 8 is set to LOW. You can connect another device to pin 8 (e.g., an LED or a relay) to control it based on the sensor's input.
